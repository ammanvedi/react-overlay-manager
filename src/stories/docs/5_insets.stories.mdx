# Insets

You may have elements in the UI that you want overlays to avoid, but you
may not want to add these as overlays to achieve this. A common example
would be if you have a navigation bar and you want overlays to sit under this.

You can use insets to help in situations like this. In the example below
we have a navigation bar.

Give it a scroll and see what happens to the overlay;

<Story height={'300px'} id="hidden-stories--inset-story" />

In this case we apply an inset to the top side, but we can apply them
to any of the 4 sides of the screen viewport using the OverlaySide enum;

<img width="600px" style={{margin: '0 auto', display: 'block'}} src="https://i.imgur.com/qf32Jnf.png" />

The overlay will avoid the navigation bar and will recalculate the
inset on scroll. There is a bit of effort needed to achieve this as
can be seen in the example code

```tsx dark="true"
import { useCallback, useContext, useEffect } from "react";
import { OverlayContext, OverlaySide, Overlay } from "react-overlay-manager";

/**
* We assume this component is wrapped by the OverlayContextProvider
* somewhere higher in the tree
*/
const InsetExample = () => {
    const { setInset, recalculateInsets, removeInset } = useContext(OverlayContext);

    /**
    * We define the callback that will be invoked when the ref is
    * passed to the component.
    */
    const refCb = useCallback((ref) => {
        setInset({
            /**
            * Give the inset a unique id
            */
            id: 'navigation',
            /**
            * Inset value can either be a ref or a number
            */
            insetValue: ref,
            /**
            * Which side of the screen should this affect
            */
            side: OverlaySide.TOP,
            /**
            * The inset size is based on the size of the element we pass,
            * if we want to add some extra spacing we can define that here
            */
            extraPaddingPx: 16,
        });
    }, []);

    useEffect(() => {
        /**
        * We should call the recalculate insets function when we do
        * something that might change the inset, we leave this up to you
        * as the implementer as you will know best when this might happen
        *
        * p.s. dont worry this function is already throttled by the library so you
        * dont have to worry about calling it too often!
        */
        window.addEventListener('scroll', recalculateInsets);

        return () => {
            /**
            * when we dispose of the component remember to dispose of the inset
            */
            removeInset('navigation');
            window.removeEventListener('scroll', recalculateInsets);
        };
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            <nav ref={refCb} />
            <Overlay .../>
        </div>
    )
}
```
