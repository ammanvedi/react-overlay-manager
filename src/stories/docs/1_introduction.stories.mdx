# React Overlay Manager

React Overlay Manager is a set of React components for positioning floating overlays over your application
in a declarative manner. It has the following features;

1. Place overlays in a declarative manner in one of 8 positions
2. Automatically avoid existing overlays
3. Order overlays with priorities
4. Avoid existing UI elements, for example navigation bars.
5. Define rules for positioning overlay based on media queries
6. Constraints on display for example limiting number of overlays in a certain position

This library is a product of some ideas I have implemented at various workplaces where we needed
to enable develoers to add overlays to a page without having to worry about testing them
in every permutation or interaction with other overlays across the site.

With `react-overlay-manager` you will be able to define rules and rest easy knowing that layout will be
handled properly.

## Installation

You can install the package via NPM

`npm install --save react-overlay-manager`

## How Does It Work?

The diagram below shows the general idea. The package provides a `OverlayContextProvider` which
should wrap your application. Also provided is a `Overlay` component that should wrap the
overlay you want to display.

For each `Overlay` component we create a portal that we render into a layer above your application

## Performance Considerations
This is a stress test, you can see that the overlay manager performs
well even when updates are dispatched to it every 100ms. Layout updates are throttled
and consecutive updates are dispatched to the end of the event queue to avoid potentially
starving other code when a-lot of overlays are rendered
